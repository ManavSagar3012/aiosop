## 1. Executive Summary

This certificate verifies the overall quality, operational validity, and finding trustworthiness of the AI-OSOP security engagement. Unlike a standard report, the Mission Quality Certificate is a **verifiable cryptographic and logical attestation** that the platform performed real work, successfully mapped the target, and only reported highly-verifiable, high-quality findings.

## 2. Platform Reality Metrics

| Metric | Value | Verification Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Assets Discovered** | 1 | Neo4j Graph Memory |
| **Endpoints Mapped** | 1 | Neo4j Graph Memory |
| **Total Findings** | 1 | Neo4j Graph Memory |
| **Reportable (CONFIRMED)** | 0 | Finding Certification Engine |
| **Needs Validation (POTENTIAL)** | 1 | Finding Certification Engine |
| **Reconnaissance (RECON, non-reportable)** | 0 | Finding Certification Engine |
| **Avg Evidence Completeness** | 100.0% | Attestation Pipeline |

> **Reportability note:** Only **CONFIRMED** findings (validated impact + reproducible PoC)
> are candidates for submission to a bug-bounty program. **RECON** findings are
> technology/infrastructure detections and are never reportable. **POTENTIAL**
> findings require manual validation and a working PoC before they could be submitted.

## 3. Findings Certification Inventory

| Finding ID | Title | Severity | Class | Confidence | Reportable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vuln-3bbd9d9dd7a8` | CAA Record | **info** | 🟡 POTENTIAL | 95.0% | ❌ NO |

## 4. Quality Statement
ℹ️ **Reconnaissance complete; no reportable vulnerabilities.** The engagement mapped the attack surface, but **0 findings are CONFIRMED** (validated impact + PoC). 1 POTENTIAL finding(s) need manual validation before they could be reported; 0 RECON detection(s) (technology/CDN/WAF/framework fingerprints) are informational and **not** reportable to a bounty program. No items should be submitted as-is.
